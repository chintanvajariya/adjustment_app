# Motor Adjustment App

## Purpose
There are dozens of places in our 2e- ARPES system that could be misaligned. We have set up alignment systems for the ultraviolet rays and their harmonic generation, the time-of-flight sensors, the data collection, and much more. However, none of these calibrations will provide consistent results if our superconductor is placed and angled erroneously in the chamber. As such, this app is wrapped around a custom motor angle and position calculator initially written in Python and rewritten in Dart to ensure these values can be adjusted before every trial.
